  * In Starting Out With Visual C# 2012, Gaddis makes a very detailed and evenly paced presentation of both programming and C# syntax concepts so all readers will be able to follow along. His GUI-based approach to teaching C# will resonate with students in CS, IT, and CIS courses. While the book is written for readers with no prior programming background, even experienced programmers will benefit from its depth of detail.

Gaddis motivates the study of both programming skills and the Visual C# programming language by presenting all the details needed to understand the “how” and the “why”–but never losing sight of the fact that most beginners struggle with this material.
